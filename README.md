"""
Subject of the contest is to code the shortest possible python module that
converts decimal numbers to the seven-segment display format. To support
leading zeroes the decimal number is given as a string.
A string containing "23" will result in:
	 _  _
	 _| _|
	|_  _|
Or more precisely in the string:
" _  _ \n _| _|\n|_  _|\n"
The module has to be named seven_seg and has to define the function seven_seg.
The function seven_seg takes a string as parameter and returns a string.
